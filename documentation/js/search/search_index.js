The majority of the tool's logic should reside in the discover function, not the fix function.\nThe fix function in each node tool has a template layout as follows:\n/*****************************************************************\n * Fixes issues in the item provided.\n * @param {object} canvasItem - Canvas item produced by the Canvas API Wrapper\n * @param {IssueItem} issueItem - The IssueItem for the item, including its issues\n * @param {object} options - Options specific to the tool selected by the user\n * @returns {array} fixedIssues - All issues discovered.\n *****************************************************************/\nfunction fix(canvasItem, issueItem, options) {\n    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {\n        try {\n            if (/*meets condition */true) {\n                issueItem.issues.forEach(issue => {\n                    if(issue.status === 'approved') {\n                        // make the changes here\n\n                        // set the issue status to 'fixed'\n                        issue.status = 'fixed';\n                    }\n                });\n                // after making the change, update the item in Canvas\n                await canvasItem.update();\n                resolve();\n            }\n        } catch (e) {\n            issueItem.issues.forEach(issue => {\n                if (issue.status === 'approved') {\n                    issue.status = 'failed';\n                }\n            });\n            reject(e);\n        }\n    });\n}Example (Alt Attributes Tool)\nHere is an example of a node tool that replaces Alt attributes on image html tags:\nconst cheerio = require('cheerio');\n\n/*****************************************************************\n * Discovers issues in the item provided.\n * @param {object} canvasItem -

As it stands, a developer key is not available to the team working on the Katana project. As an alternative, which coincedently opens up several new opportunities by integrating with Google authentication, Katana uses Firebase authentication with only Google Accounts allowed. Users cannot create new accounts, and must use an existing Google account. It must be a BYUI G-Suite Account, or their google account will be removed from Katana instantaneously.\nSign-Up Process\nWhen a user accesses Katana for the first time, they will be redirected to a Google login page. It will allow them to log in with any google account, but it will keep looping them back to the login page if they use a standard gmail or non-BYUI google account. After successfully logging into a valid BYUI google account, they will be taken back to Katana, where they will be automatically logged in.\nHowever, they cannot access the tool quite yet. It may continue to loop them back to the Google login page, even with a BYUI Google account. This is because all accounts are automatically disabled on creation (see below). This helps prevent unwanted users from accessing it without being given access manually. An admin must enable their account before they can continue.\nAuthentication Process\nBelow is a diagram with a simple overview of the authentication process using Firebase. This is the flow after the user has successfully signed up with a valid account. \n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/firebase/database-structure.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/firebase/database-structure.html","title":"additional-page - Database Structure","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Structure\nThe structure of the database is simple. It's sole purpose is to store logs.\nThe current Katana structure uses Firestore, a product produced by Firebase. It is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database that handles datatypes easier than Firebase database.\nKatana uses its own Firestore Wrapper to handle sending information to the database. Refer to that if you are currently developing in Katana and would like to learn more about interfacing with Firestore.\nCollections\nCollections in a NoSQL database are similar to tables. They are just a \"collection\" of \"documents.\" A document is similar to a row in a standard database table. They can also be thought of as a stored JSON object (with a bit more control over datatypes).\nThe current setup requires three collections:\n\n\n\nCollection Title\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nuser_logs\nThis can store logs for user actions. This can include users logging in and out, changing account information, and similar actions. (BYUI Katana instance currently only stores users logging in and out)\n\n\nserver_logs\nActions taken by the server or significant events that should be logged should be logged here. This might include suspicious endpoint activity, or even just any request made to the server. (BYUI Katana instance currently does not store any information in this collection)\n\n\ntool_logs\nThis should be used to store logs generated by tools being run by users. (BYUI Katana instance currently stores every tool that runs, along with any related IssueItems)\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/firebase/firestore-wrapper.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/firebase/firestore-wrapper.html","title":"additional-page - Firestore Wrapper","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirestore Wrapper\nThe Firestore Wrapper, which is built specifically for Katana, is a small, easy wrapper used to log actions to Firestore. It does nothing more.\nView firestore-wrapper.js on Github\nSetup\nIf you use this separately from Katana, which it is not built for, the structure of your database will need to match what is described in Database Structure. It also requires the firebase-admin package to properly run. To implement the wrapper in your code:\nconst firestoreWrapper = require('./firestore-wrapper.js');\nconst db = firestoreWrapper.initializeFirebase();\nFrom there on, db can be used to access all of Firestore's API.\n\nFunctions\nFour public functions are exposed by the wrapper's export:\n\n\n\nMethod\nParameters\nReturns\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nserverLog(data)\ndata (object)\nvoid\nThis saves data to the server_logs collection in Firestore, such as when a specific API is being tracked.\n\n\ntoolLog(data)\ndata (object)\nvoid\nThis saves data to the tool_logs collection in Firestore. Typically used for when tools are being ran.\n\n\nuserLog(data)\ndata (object)\nvoid\nThis saves data to the tool_logs collection in Firestore. Typically logs when users log in and out. Please note that this only logs the user's email and information pertinent to the action that occurred. No other user information is stored.\n\n\ninitializeFirebase()\nnone\nDatabase Reference\nInitializes the app and returns a reference to the database. The database reference is also used internally, so this function must be called before using any other external functions. This will also console log any database logging if the --db flag was given at startup. It will log all information provided to log, which can be quite long. It is not recommended that you use this flag. It is available for development purposes.\n\n\n\nOne private function is used internally:\n\n\n\nMethod\nParameters\nReturns\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n_log(collectionTitle, data)\ncollectionTitle(string)data (object)\nvoid\nUsed by the logging functions available externally, this just logs data to Firestore. The other functions are just wrappers for this internal function.\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/firebase/firebase-functions.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/firebase/firebase-functions.html","title":"additional-page - Firebase Functions","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirebase Functions\nFirebase provides a service called Firebase Functions that allows functions to be written that run on key events fired on the database. This is used to control if an account is valid or not when a user signs up. Currently, only one function is deployed to the BYUI instance of Katana.\n\n\n\nFunction\nEvent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nverifyNewUsers()\nfunctions.auth.user().onCreate(...)\nChecks whether or not the user is a BYUI Google account, and if they are not, removes their account immediately. If they are, it disables their account and revokes their refresh tokens (to disable their current session).\n\n\n\nYou must be an admin or owner on your firebase instance to deploy Firebase Functions.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
