tool is built to interface with Canvas, a Learning Management System built by Instructure. It provides the framework for a development team to build and deploy mass-maintenance tools. It is not built by Instructure. It was built by Brigham Young University - Idaho, and is maintained by them.\nSetup - Production\nTo set up your own instance of Katana, follow these steps:\n\nInstall Git and use it to clone the repository\n\nInstall NodeJS if is not installed\n\nIn the terminal, run: npm install\n\n(TEMP: Set up CANVAS_API_TOKEN environment variable | Will become canvas developer key)\n\nDeploy Firebase using the steps described in this document\n\nBuild production files with ng build --prod\n\n\n\n\nIn the terminal, run: npm start to start server.js (which will start Katana on port 8000)\n\nFollow any additional setup processes you need\n\n\nDevelopment\nFor development, use this command to build the angular front-end and launch the server immediately after:\nnpm run fullbuild\nIt can then be accessed via localhost:8000 (or whichever port you specify in server/settings.json).\nYou can also deploy it for others to use by using your IP Address and your port number. So if you were running on port 8000 and your IP Address was 10.1.182.255 then you could deploy it on your network with the url 10.1.182.255:8000, though hosting it on a server with a url for your users to access would of course be better.\nDocumentation\nAdditional Setup\nSet up a Node Tool\nSet up Firebase\nEnabling Accounts on Firebase\nClient Architecture (Angular)\nAngular Structure Documentation \nServer Architecture (Express)\nLinkName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -

This will guide you through settings up all three on a brand new instance. If you already have an instance set up, but need to set up your instance's Firebase service account key, you'll just need to generate a new private key.\nFirebase Authentication\nIn order for the server to be able to authenticate each request that is sent to it (i.e. to run a tool), it needs to have access to a \"Service Account.\" This is essentially a developer key, but for firebase. It just allows an application to act as an admin on Firebase without an actual account.\nGenerate Private Key\nTo create the key for the service account:\n\nGo to the Firebase Console and navigate to the Katana project\nClick the \"Settings\" icon next to the \"Project Overview\" button at the top left\nSelect \"Project Settings\"\nSelect the \"Service accounts\" tab\nMake sure \"Firebase Admin SDK\" is selected, and that \"Node.js\" is selected as the Admin SDK configuration snippet\nClick \"Generate new private key\" at the bottom (this will download a file)\nRename the downloaded file to auth.json and move it into the server directory in your instance of Katana\nThat's it! Katana's server will now be able to integrate with your instance of Firebase\n\nIntegrating Firebase by creating a private key, as described above, will complete the needed steps for setting up authentication, but there are a few things to be aware of. Currently:\n\nKatana depends entirely on Google accounts. Users cannot create new accounts, use Facebook, or other means to log in.\n\nFirebase Database\nKatana uses Firestore. It is a NoSQL database, similiar to Firebase Database, but with greater functionality. It is currently used just to store logs.\nFollow Firebase's Instructions to set up your instance of Firestore. After that, you will need to create these collections:\n\nserver_logs\nstatistics\ntool_logs\nuser_logs\n\nThese are identified by name by Katana, so having these names match exactly is important. Additional collections can be added as needed - they won't interfere.\nFirebase Functions\nFirebase Functions is a feature that allows you to deploy event listeners that fire on certain database actions. It is entirely backend. Currently, its only purpose is to verify that the user is using a Google BYUI account (\"@byui.edu\"). This can be adjusted for any instance, or entirely excluded. \nDeploying Firebase Functions is very simple. The instructions can be found here.\nYou may need to create a git repository or a submodule. I would recommend a submodule (which is currently not being used, ironically).\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/setup/node-tools.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/setup/node-tools.html","title":"additional-page - Node Tools","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode Tools\nOverview\nA Node Tool contains a single fix for a Canvas Course (ex: Alt-Attributes). \nNode Tools are divided up into categories (HTML, item settings, etc.).\nEach Node Tool resides within it's own file, located in the /server/node_tools directory.\nEach node tool will follow the same process and have the same settings/options available. \nThese processes, settings, and options are explained below.\nTool Object - i.e. Tool Settings\nThe tool object determines the tool's basic information such as name, description, icon, tool type, and more. \nIt also determines the tool's behavior such as which items in Canvas should be pulled and altered.\nThe tool object should be located at the bottom of each individual tool.\nThe following table describes the tool object in detail.\nProperties that are object arrays (an array of objects) are explained in detail below the table.\n\n\n\nObject Key\nType\nOptions\nDescription\nExample\nRequired\n\n\n\n\ncategories\nstring array\nassignments, discussions, files, moduleItems, modules, pages, quizzes, quizQuestions\nAn array of the Canvas item types to be searched for/fixed in the tool\n['assignments', 'discussions', 'pages']\ntrue\n\n\ndescription\nstring\n\nThe description of the tool that will be displayed on the options page\n'This tool allows you to...'\ntrue\n\n\ndiscover\nfunction\n\nThe function that will tell the tool what items to get from Canvas and decide how to display them\nSee below for details\ntrue\n\n\ndiscoverOptions\nobject array\n\nAn object array that describes the available discover/search options that will appear on the options page before the tool is run\nSee below for details\ntrue\n\n\neditorTabs\nobject array\n\nAn object array that determines the setup of the code editors to be seen on each issue card\nSee below for details\nfalse\n\n\nfix\nfunction\n\nThe function that will tell the tool what items to fix and how to do it\nSee below for details\ntrue\n\n\nicon\nstring\n\nAny icon name found on Material Design Icons\n'text_rotation_none'\ntrue\n\n\nid\nstring\n\nThe tool name in all lowercase letters and using underscores for spaces.

As it stands, a developer key is not available to the team working on the Katana project. As an alternative, which coincedently opens up several new opportunities by integrating with Google authentication, Katana uses Firebase authentication with only Google Accounts allowed. Users cannot create new accounts, and must use an existing Google account. It must be a BYUI G-Suite Account, or their google account will be removed from Katana instantaneously.\nSign-Up Process\nWhen a user accesses Katana for the first time, they will be redirected to a Google login page. It will allow them to log in with any google account, but it will keep looping them back to the login page if they use a standard gmail or non-BYUI google account. After successfully logging into a valid BYUI google account, they will be taken back to Katana, where they will be automatically logged in.\nHowever, they cannot access the tool quite yet. It may continue to loop them back to the Google login page, even with a BYUI Google account. This is because all accounts are automatically disabled on creation (see below). This helps prevent unwanted users from accessing it without being given access manually. An admin must enable their account before they can continue.\nAuthentication Process\nBelow is a diagram with a simple overview of the authentication process using Firebase. This is the flow after the user has successfully signed up with a valid account. \n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/firebase/database-structure.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/firebase/database-structure.html","title":"additional-page - Database Structure","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Structure\nThe structure of the database is simple. It's sole purpose is to store logs.\nThe current Katana structure uses Firestore, a product produced by Firebase. It is a cloud-hosted, NoSQL database that handles datatypes easier than Firebase database.\nKatana uses its own Firestore Wrapper to handle sending information to the database. Refer to that if you are currently developing in Katana and would like to learn more about interfacing with Firestore.\nCollections\nCollections in a NoSQL database are similar to tables. They are just a \"collection\" of \"documents.\" A document is similar to a row in a standard database table. They can also be thought of as a stored JSON object (with a bit more control over datatypes).\nThe current setup requires three collections:\n\n\n\nCollection Title\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nuser_logs\nThis can store logs for user actions. This can include users logging in and out, changing account information, and similar actions. (BYUI Katana instance currently only stores users logging in and out)\n\n\nserver_logs\nActions taken by the server or significant events that should be logged should be logged here.

It does nothing more.\nView firebase_wrapper.js on Github\nSetup\nIf you use this separately from Katana, which it is not built for, the structure of your database will need to match what is described in Database Structure. It also requires the firebase-admin package to properly run. To implement the wrapper in your code:\nconst firebaseWrapper = require('./firebase_wrapper.js');\nconst db = firebaseWrapper.initializeFirebase();\nFrom there on, db can be used to access all of Firestore's API.\n\nFunctions\nThese public functions are exposed by the wrapper's export:\n\n\n\nMethod\nParameters\nReturns\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nserverLog(data)\ndata (object)\nvoid\nThis saves data to the server_logs collection in Firestore, such as when a specific API is being tracked.\n\n\ntoolLog(data)\ndata (object)\nvoid\nThis saves data to the tool_logs collection in Firestore. Typically used for when tools are being ran.\n\n\nuserLog(data)\ndata (object)\nvoid\nThis saves data to the tool_logs collection in Firestore. Typically logs when users log in and out. Please note that this only logs the user's email and information pertinent to the action that occurred. No other user information is stored.\n\n\ninitializeFirebase()\nnone\nDatabase Reference\nInitializes the app and returns a reference to the database. The database reference is also used internally, so this function must be called before using any other external functions. This will also console log any database logging if the --db flag was given at startup. It will log all information provided to log, which can be quite long. It is not recommended that you use this flag. It is available for development purposes.\n\n\nincrementCounts(category, statistic, count)\ncategory {string} statistic {string} count {number}\nvoid\nUsed to increment counts saved under statistics in Firestore.\n\n\n\nOne private function is used internally:\n\n\n\nMethod\nParameters\nReturns\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n_log(collectionTitle, data)\ncollectionTitle(string)data (object)\nvoid\nUsed by the logging functions available externally, this just logs data to Firestore. The other functions are just wrappers for this internal function.\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/firebase/firebase-functions.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/firebase/firebase-functions.html","title":"additional-page - Firebase Functions","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirebase Functions\nFirebase provides a service called Firebase Functions that allows functions to be written that run on key events fired on the database. This is used to control if an account is valid or not when a user signs up. Currently, only one function is deployed to the BYUI instance of Katana.\n\n\n\nFunction\nEvent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nverifyNewUsers()\nfunctions.auth.user().onCreate(...)\nChecks whether or not the user is a BYUI Google account, and if they are not, removes their account immediately. If they are, it disables their account and revokes their refresh tokens (to disable their current session).\n\n\n\nYou must be an admin or owner on your firebase instance to deploy Firebase Functions.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
